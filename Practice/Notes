What is functional interface ?
-> Functional interface is one of the Java 8 feature which follows the functional way of programming.
    Functional interface contains only one Abstract method. It can have default methods and static methods
    for some default response or backward compatibility.
    If you are implementing the functional interface, you must implement the only abstract method from it.
    We can create a custom Functional Interface as well by creating a class with @FunctionalInterface and 
    declaring one abstract method in it.
    Java 8 also provides its own functional interface e.g. Function, Predicate, Runnable, Consumer, Supplier
    > Function takes one parameter and returns an output after processing the parameter
        It has abstract method named apply()
        There is also BiFunctiona interface which takes 2 parameters and returns an output.
    > Predicate takes one parameter and tests the parameter as a condition and returns true or false.
    > Runnable is an interface which is used for thread creation, it has run() methode which runs the thread
