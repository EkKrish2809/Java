Java Bean is just a Java class,  but it should follow 3 main properties
1. that java class should have getters() and setters() to access the properties
2. that class should have 'public no args constructor', so that anybody can create an object of it
3. that class should implement Serializable, (beacuse java beans can be required to exported, may be 
    required to written to a database, or to a file system, or converted to JSON or XML doc to sent 
    over the network and again being Deserialized)


Spring Boot vs Spring MVC
> In Spring MVC, we actually render the web components using HTML, JSP
 whereas in Spring Boot we do not render directly on Web, instead we create response which is then used by 
 frontend technology to render UI
